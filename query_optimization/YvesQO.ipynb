    "Exercise to use PostgreSQL schema and tables contained in [data.dmp](/query_optimization/data.dmp?raw=true) to summarize some (E)nvironmental, (S)ocial, (G)overnance, and Total Impact scores for fictitious entities listed on the S&P 500. Your requirements are as follows:\n",
    "* Determine the most efficient method of joining the included `sp500`, `id_map`, and `esg_scores` tables\n",
    "* Create a new `sp500_esg_scores` table that lists all available id, name, and score columns for the S&P 500 constituent entities\n",
    "* Add a `rank` column to the new `sp500_esg_scores` table that ranks the S&P 500 constituent entities by percentile on `total_score` in ascending order\n",
    "* Add a MEDIAN row to the `sp500_esg_scores` table that shows the median value for each score column across the S&P 500 constituents \n",
    "* Make sure that where S&P 500 constituent entities are missing score values they still appear in the `sp500_esg_scores` table and are ranked in the 0 percentile\n",
    "* Suggest a database and ETL architecture if there were a much larger universe of companies eg. 50,000. This universe would be updated on a weekly basis and rankings would need to be recomputed upon update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs a `esg_analysis.dmp` file with the database code to replicate your solution as well as a `query.sql` file containing the SQL query used to produce the `sp500_esg_scores` table."

    "On the question on if there were a much larger universe of companies eg. 50,000, updated on a weekly basis and if rankings would need to be recomputed upon updates, I would offer for consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Partitioning the database by the update date of each week, which allows [among benefits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html) potential increases in query performance, ability to retain newer and/or offload older aging/dated/dump partitions for the sake of saving compute/storage resources, and ease potential [Postgres administration issues](https://onesignal.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-5-years-of-scaling-postgresql/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Consideration of a more [modular ETL architecture](https://www.sqlshack.com/designing-a-modular-etl-architecture/) allowing ability for more loosely coupled pipelines but which requires careful pipeline orchestration and data quality checks to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - For aggregated metrics e.g. medians of the different scores by date partitions, consideration of separate dimension tables to avoid having to run compute expensive queries (ie storage is cheap). [Postgres could be used](https://www.narratordata.com/blog/using-postgresql-as-a-data-warehouse/) however there are other solutions in the market as well. Much of these would depend on cost vs performance tradeoffs."
